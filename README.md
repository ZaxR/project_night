# project_night

A collection of scripts useful for hosting/managing Chicago Python User Group (ChiPy)'s Project Night, which is also pip installable. While this project was inspired by the needs of ChiPy's Project Nights, the scripts are easily generalizable for other purposes.

Scripts:
 - challenge.grouper: creates groups of participants based on an "experience level."
 - meetup.meetup: Meetup endpoint to track group members/event attendees.
